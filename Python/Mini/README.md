# Python Mini Exercises

This folder contains four small Python exercises created as part of the **Engeto Data Analyst with Python** course (2025).

Each subfolder represents one learning module:
- `01_intro_to_programming` → working with strings  
- `02_conditions_and_functions` → BMI calculator  
- `03_dictionaries_and_sets` → password check  
- `04_for_loop` → vowels and consonants counter  

Each exercise demonstrates a specific programming concept covered in the course.
